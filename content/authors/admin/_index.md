## About Me

I am a B.S. candidate in Preventive Medicine at Sun Yat-sen University, School of Public Health (Shenzhen), expected to graduate in June 2025. Throughout my academic journey, I have cultivated a deep passion for the intersection of preventive medicine and technology, focusing on the genetic epidemiology of complex diseases to uncover genetic factors influencing disease susceptibility and progression. My research interests extend to applying machine learning and deep learning techniques in epidemiological studies, leveraging large-scale health data to identify valuable patterns that can inform public health strategies. I have participated in multi-omics bioinformatics research projects on epidemics, integrating diverse datasets to develop predictive models. Technically proficient in Python, R, PyTorch, Keras, and SAS, I have experience with data processing using UK Biobank (UKB) and NHANES databases, and I am skilled in data mining and developing health prediction models. Driven by a commitment to advancing public health, I am eager to contribute to innovative research that leverages technology to address complex health challenges.

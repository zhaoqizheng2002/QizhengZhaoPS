abstract: Background This study aims to assess the global incidence, mortality, and
  disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of thyroid cancer between 1990 and 2030.
  Methods Our study analysed Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data from 204 countries,
  spanning 1990–2019. It focused on age-standardised thyroid cancer incidence, mortality,
  and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), using the sociodemographic index (SDI)
  for assessing socioeconomic levels. Generalised additive models (GAMs) projected
  thyroid cancer trends for 2020–2030. Results The global burden of thyroid cancer
  is predicted to increase significantly from 1990 to 2030. The number of thyroid
  cancer incidence cases is projected to rise from 233 846.64 in 2019 to 305 078.08
  by 2030, representing an approximate 30.46% increase. The ASIR (age-standardised
  incidence rate) is expected to continue its upward trend (estimated annual percentage
  change (EAPC) = 0.83). The age-standardised death rate (ASDR) for thyroid cancer
  is projected to decline in both genders, more notably in women (EAPC = −0.34) compared
  to men (EAPC = −0.17). The burden of disease escalates with advancing age, with
  significant regional disparities. Regions with lower SDI, particularly in South
  Asia, are anticipated to witness substantial increases in thyroid cancer incidence
  from 2020 to 2030. The overall disease burden is expected to rise, especially in
  countries with low to middle SDI, reflecting broader socio-economic and health care
  shifts. Conclusions This study highlights significant regional and gender-specific
  variations in thyroid cancer, with notable increases in incidence rates, particularly
  in areas like South Asia. These trends suggest improvements in diagnostic capabilities
  and the influence of socio-economic factors. Additionally, the observed decline
  in mortality rates across various regions reflects advancements in thyroid cancer
  management. The findings underline the critical importance of regionally tailored
  prevention strategies, robust cancer registries, and public health initiatives to
  address the evolving landscape of thyroid cancer and mitigate health disparities
  globally.

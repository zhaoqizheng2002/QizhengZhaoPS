 abstract = {Fall, a leading cause of accidental death and injury in older adults aged 65 and above, has become a rapidly growing health concern in aging populations worldwide. Data-driven methods integrating depth imaging technology have received growing attention in automated fall risk assessment owing to their non-invasiveness and less dependence on healthcare professionals. However, most existing depth image data-based models neglect the inherent physiological and potential functional connections and lack sufficient real-world data validation. To fill the research gap, we developed a novel approach named Multi-scale Skeletal Transformer (MSS-Former), leveraging depth image technology and deep learning models for effective fall risk prediction. Our contributions mainly consist of four parts. First, we introduced a multi-model output feature fusion transformer in fall risk prediction, enabling output merging and weighting from multiple model streams dynamically. Second, we developed an innovative scheme to construct inter-joint skeletal topology, systematically focusing on joints’ intrinsic physiological and potential functional connections. Third, we constructed a ResNet-FPN, greatly enhancing multi-scale feature extraction capabilities. Fourth, we conducted a field study in a local hospital and performed a comprehensive validation of our developed approach. The comparison results show that our approach achieved outstanding predictive performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the real-world dataset, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 97.84%, 97.33%, 96.97%, and 96.92%, respectively. In practice, the proposed approach would be of great value in the timely identification for individuals at high fall risk, and facilitate decision-making to take appropriate interventions.},

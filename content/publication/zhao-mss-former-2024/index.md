abstract: Fall, a leading cause of accidental death and injury in older adults aged
  65 and above, has become a rapidly growing health concern in aging populations worldwide.
  Data-driven methods integrating depth imaging technology have received growing attention
  in automated fall risk assessment owing to their non-invasiveness and less dependence
  on healthcare professionals. However, most existing depth image data-based models
  neglect the inherent physiological and potential functional connections and lack
  sufficient real-world data validation. To fill the research gap, we developed a
  novel approach named Multi-scale Skeletal Transformer (MSS-Former), leveraging depth
  image technology and deep learning models for effective fall risk prediction. Our
  contributions mainly consist of four parts. First, we introduced a multi-model output
  feature fusion transformer in fall risk prediction, enabling output merging and
  weighting from multiple model streams dynamically. Second, we developed an innovative
  scheme to construct inter-joint skeletal topology, systematically focusing on jointsâ€™
  intrinsic physiological and potential functional connections. Third, we constructed
  a ResNet-FPN, greatly enhancing multi-scale feature extraction capabilities. Fourth,
  we conducted a field study in a local hospital and performed a comprehensive validation
  of our developed approach. The comparison results show that our approach achieved
  outstanding predictive performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the real-world
  dataset, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 97.84%, 97.33%, 96.97%,
  and 96.92%, respectively. In practice, the proposed approach would be of great value
  in the timely identification for individuals at high fall risk, and facilitate decision-making
  to take appropriate interventions.

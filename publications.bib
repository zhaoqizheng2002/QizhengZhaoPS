	abstract = {Background This study aims to assess the global incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) of thyroid cancer between 1990 and 2030.
Methods Our study analysed Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2019 data from 204 countries, spanning 1990–2019. It focused on age-standardised thyroid cancer incidence, mortality, and disability-adjusted life years (DALYs), using the sociodemographic index (SDI) for assessing socioeconomic levels. Generalised additive models (GAMs) projected thyroid cancer trends for 2020–2030.
Results The global burden of thyroid cancer is predicted to increase significantly from 1990 to 2030. The number of thyroid cancer incidence cases is projected to rise from 233 846.64 in 2019 to 305 078.08 by 2030, representing an approximate 30.46\% increase. The ASIR (age-standardised incidence rate) is expected to continue its upward trend (estimated annual percentage change (EAPC) = 0.83). The age-standardised death rate (ASDR) for thyroid cancer is projected to decline in both genders, more notably in women (EAPC = −0.34) compared to men (EAPC = −0.17). The burden of disease escalates with advancing age, with significant regional disparities. Regions with lower SDI, particularly in South Asia, are anticipated to witness substantial increases in thyroid cancer incidence from 2020 to 2030. The overall disease burden is expected to rise, especially in countries with low to middle SDI, reflecting broader socio-economic and health care shifts.
Conclusions This study highlights significant regional and gender-specific variations in thyroid cancer, with notable increases in incidence rates, particularly in areas like South Asia. These trends suggest improvements in diagnostic capabilities and the influence of socio-economic factors. Additionally, the observed decline in mortality rates across various regions reflects advancements in thyroid cancer management. The findings underline the critical importance of regionally tailored prevention strategies, robust cancer registries, and public health initiatives to address the evolving landscape of thyroid cancer and mitigate health disparities globally.},

	abstract = {Fall, a leading cause of accidental death and injury in older adults aged 65 and above, has become a rapidly growing health concern in aging populations worldwide. Data-driven methods integrating depth imaging technology have received growing attention in automated fall risk assessment owing to their non-invasiveness and less dependence on healthcare professionals. However, most existing depth image data-based models neglect the inherent physiological and potential functional connections and lack sufficient real-world data validation. To fill the research gap, we developed a novel approach named Multi-scale Skeletal Transformer (MSS-Former), leveraging depth image technology and deep learning models for effective fall risk prediction. Our contributions mainly consist of four parts. First, we introduced a multi-model output feature fusion transformer in fall risk prediction, enabling output merging and weighting from multiple model streams dynamically. Second, we developed an innovative scheme to construct inter-joint skeletal topology, systematically focusing on joints’ intrinsic physiological and potential functional connections. Third, we constructed a ResNet-FPN, greatly enhancing multi-scale feature extraction capabilities. Fourth, we conducted a field study in a local hospital and performed a comprehensive validation of our developed approach. The comparison results show that our approach achieved outstanding predictive performance, surpassing state-of-the-art methods on the real-world dataset, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores of 97.84\%, 97.33\%, 96.97\%, and 96.92\%, respectively. In practice, the proposed approach would be of great value in the timely identification for individuals at high fall risk, and facilitate decision-making to take appropriate interventions.},
